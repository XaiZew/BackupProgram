# Simple file transfer files/folders program that's more efficient than regular copy pasting.
This program works by comparing the MD5 hashes of every file in the target directory to see if the file you're trying to transfer already exists and if it does already exist then if the file youre trying to transfer is newer than the file already stored in the target directory, the new file will overwrite the current file, if not then it skips said file.
This can be useful if you are working on a project in a group or if by yourself and are working on a different drive for example, and you have an older version than the latest of the project you are working on then you can still work on said project and only upload the files you've updated/new files without having to manually select the files you wish to upload and instead can upload the entire projects directory without worry that newer files on the target project/directory will be overwritten.
